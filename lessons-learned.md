1. Don't trim unused prototypes. They will be compared during decoding to see if the schema has changed.
2. Warn on encountering unknown prototype in encoding
3. Some kind of validation?
4. Embed a date into header
5. Maybe there is a way to encode the prototype state??
6. USE ZOD SCHEMAS!!!

Shorten error messages and make them more legible
Consider formatting
